# Research Project

Students complete a research project in three scenarios including:

**1. Students intend to prepare a research project in PSYC565 without the intent to collect data. ** 

In this case, students are thinking to set themselves up for success in completing their dissertation. Time spent in 565 writing a literature, making a well-organized OSF project, writing R Code, and preparing a pre-registration will be invaluable. 

**2. Students *intended* to collect data but sitautions occurred preventing them from doing so.**

In this case, students have the benefit of #1 although it was not their initial hope.  These students will have to complete the comprehensive exam.  If they completed PSYC565 then that will serve as their elective.

**3. Students are conducting a Research Project**

A research project can be similar to a program evaluation.  The project is largely similar to the thesis except that the student will not have a thesis to be bound and will not have to submit their work to Thesis Commons.
