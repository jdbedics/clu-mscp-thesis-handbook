The full thesis option includes the development of your own independent research project which typically include the collection, analysis, and publication of data. Courses in your second year include: Class Semester Units Research Seminar (565) Fall 3 ABA Fall 3 Specialization Part I Fall 3 Thesis Units (566) Spring 3 Specialization Part II Spring 3 1.2 Full Comprehensive Exam Option If you decided, 100%, on comprehensive exams and will not take the Research Seminar in the Fall: Courses in your second year include: Class Semester Units ABA Fall 3 Specialization Part I Fall 3 Elective Spring 3 Specialization Part II Spring 3 Comprehensive Exam Spring 0 The elective (3-units) could be Part II of any specialization or anything that Dr. Bedics approves. The 3-units are required to make up for not having the Research Seminar in the Fall. You also want to take this in the Spring b/c if you take in the Fall you will only have 3 units in the spring which will make you less than part-time (not good!). 1.3 Thesis Lite Version Here you can take the Research Seminar (565) in the Fall but not complete the thesis in the spring. People do this when they want to start a research project but then use it as a launching pad for a dissertation so they do not collect data in the Spring. People also use this when they start the thesis with the intent to collect data but things do not work out with their sample or other issues come up that would prevent completion of the thesis. Courses in your second year include: Class Semester Units Research Seminar (565) Fall 3 ABA Fall 3 Specialization Part I Fall 3 Specialization Part II Spring 3 Comprehensive Exam Spring 0 In this situation, the Research seminar in the Fall has served as your elective. You can, if you like, take another elective if you want to maintain your part-time student status. "],

["thesis-committee.html", "Section 3 Thesis Committee 3.1 What you need: 3.2 How to get a committee: 3.3 Working with your committee", " Section 3 Thesis Committee 3.1 What you need: Two committee members. One committee member serves as “chair.” The chair is the person that gives you the most feedback The second committee member is a “reader” and provides limited feedback on major milestones of the thesis including the IRB draft, the final paper from PSYC565, and the final draft of the thesis. One committee member must be from CLU (chair or reader; doesn’t matter). Outside committee members are required to submit a Vita to the program director. 3.2 How to get a committee: For many faculty, being on a thesis committee is a lot of work with little payoff. Consequently, it can be a challenge to find faculty to support your research project. How you approach faculty is critical. Please contact the program director before reaching out to prospective committee members. Identifying potential faculty – Search the CLU website for potential faculty that could contribute to your idea. Look at faculty interests in graduate psychology, undergraduate psychology, as well as other departments at CLU. You could also identify faculty at other universities that might serve on the committee. Foot-in-the-door – Introduce yourself to faculty through email. Do not ask them to join your committee. Instead, ask them if they have time to answer questions about your project. The point here is that if they are not willing to give you any feedback then they will never be willing to be on your committee. The foot-in-the-door strategy allows you to get some feedback even if they are not willing to be on your committee. Here is an example email: Dear Dr. ###, My name is STUDENT and I am currently developing my master’s thesis project at California Lutheran University. The topic is on &lt;TOPIC&gt;. I think your expertise in &lt;AREA&gt; would help me in thinking through some of the details of my project. I was curious if you could make time to answer a few questions over email or perhaps even chat over the phone. I appreciate your time and will be as concise as possible. I have attached a brief summary of my project. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, First Last Name Requesting committee membership – At some point you will have to ask faculty to join your committee. It is best to let the director make this request. The director can email the potential committee member and discuss the role of the chair and reader as well as compensation for their time. The following information is often communicated to the potential committee members: 3.3 Working with your committee The committee will be most successful if you establish clear expectations of when you will talk or email with each other. Clearly established expectations will prevent you from emailing too little or too much. Establish the following: Make a clear statment that you would like to be mindful of their time and not approach them too much nor too little. How often would they like to look at your work? How often would they like to talk/video conference? "],

You cannot, however, display your work if it remains in a private OSF repository. At the end of the thesis, in order to complete the thesis, you must make either your whole or portions of your OSF project public. "],
["thesis-binding.html", "Section 6 Thesis Binding", " Section 6 Thesis Binding At least three (3) bound copies of the Thesis must be ordered. One copy for the Graduate School of Psychology, one copy for the Thesis Committee Chair, and one personal copy for your possession. You can order more if you prefer (see #2). The three copies must be printed on 25% rag or cotton fiber watermarked white paper, at least 20 pound weight, 8½ x 11 inches in size (EZERASE, or similar paper is not acceptable). A good example is Southworth Fine Business Paper, 25% cotton, 24 pound, white, stock #403C which is available for purchase from Office Depot, Officemax, and Staples. A similar 20 pound weight paper is also available. Original signed signature pages on the same paper must be submitted with each of the three copies. Additional personal copies may be ordered at the same time. Personal copies may be printed on paper of the student’s choice (e.g., 20 pound paper). Signature pages for the personal copies may be photocopies of the originals as long as they are on paper that is identical to the rest of the thesis. Copies for binding must be delivered to the Program Specialist. The copies delivered to the Program Specialist are NOT to be bound - just packaged with bright colored paper separating the individual copies. Students are responsible for paying binding fees for all copies (the three required copies and for any additional personal copies). The cost is $40 per copy (no matter the length), and to be paid by check to CLU. Prices may change. The Program Specialist will forward the copies to the bindery as they are delivered. Once the Program Specialist receives the copies and payment for binding, a change of grade will be submitted to the Registrar’s Office. The bound copies are typically ready in about 6-8 weeks and are distributed as follows: The Graduate School of Psychology copy and the Thesis Committee Chair copy will be delivered via campus mail by the Program Specialist. Students will be notified when their personal copies are ready for pick-up. If you have any questions regarding the binding process, please do not hesitate to contact Mengmeng Liu, Graduate Program Specialist, at 805-493-3662 or at mengmengliu@callutheran.edu. "],

["research-project.html", "Section 9 Research Project", " Section 9 Research Project Students complete a research project in three scenarios including: 1. Students intend to prepare a research project in PSYC565 without the intent to collect data. In this case, students are thinking to set themselves up for success in completing their dissertation. Time spent in 565 writing a literature, making a well-organized OSF project, writing R Code, and preparing a pre-registration will be invaluable. 2. Students intended to collect data but sitautions occurred preventing them from doing so. In this case, students have the benefit of #1 although it was not their initial hope. These students will have to complete the comprehensive exam. If they completed PSYC565 then that will serve as their elective. 3. Students are conducting a Research Project A research project can be similar to a program evaluation. The project is largely similar to the thesis except that the student will not have a thesis to be bound and will not have to submit their work to Thesis Commons. Students completing a Research Project (option 3) with the complete the following: Task Date Due Finished Topic Approved [ ] Director[ ] Instructor Organized and Publics OSF - [ ] Literature Review on Topic - [ ] IRB [ ] Draft[ ] Submitted Reproducible R Code - [ ] A final R Markdown Report - [ ] A final Presentation (prferably made in R) - [ ] GitHub Blog Optional [ ] Shiny App Optional [ ] "],
