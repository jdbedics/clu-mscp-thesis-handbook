Students intend to prepare a research project in PSYC565 without the intent to collect data. In this case, students are thinking to set themselves up for success in completing their dissertation. Time spent in 565 writing a literature, making a well-organized OSF project, writing R Code, and preparing a pre-registration will be invaluable. 2. Students intended to collect data but sitautions occurred preventing them from doing so. In this case, students have the benefit of #1 although it was not their initial hope. These students will have to complete the comprehensive exam. If they completed PSYC565 then that will serve as their elective. 3. Students are conducting a Research Project A research project can be similar to a program evaluation.
