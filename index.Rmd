## FULL THESIS OPTION

If you take the research seminar class (565) in the Fall and also complete the Thesis in the Spring.  When you think thesis, you can think your own independent research or if you're doing a type of program evaluation.  The latter still counts at "thesis" option as there is a clear deliverable at the the end of Spring. 

*Fall*

1. PSYC565 Research Seminar (3 Units) 2. ABA (3 Units) 3. Specialization Part I  (one class only; 3 Units)

*Spring*

1. Specialization Part II (one class only (3 units); part 2 of your first one) 2. Thesis units (3 Units)

## FULL COMPREHENSIVE EXAM OPTION.  

If you decided, 100%, on comprehensive exams and will not take the Research Seminar in the Fall:

*Fall*

1. ABA (3 Units) 2. Specialization Part I (one class only; 3 Units)

*Spring*

1. Specialization Part II (one class only for 3 Units; part 2 of your first one)

2. An elective (3-units).  This could be Part II of any specialization or anything that Jamie approves. See me.  You need these 3 units to make up for not having the Research Seminar in the Fall. You also want to take this in the Spring b/c if you take in the Fall you will only have 3 units in the spring which will make you less than part-time (not good!).

3. Register for the Comprehensive Exam.

## THESIS LITE VERSION.  

Here you can take the Research Seminar (565) in the Fall but not complete the thesis in the spring. People do this when they want to start a research project but then use it as a launching pad for a dissertation so they do not collect data in the Spring.  People also use this when they start the thesis with the intent to collect data but things do not work out with their sample or other issues come up that would prevent completion of the thesis.

Fall - Same as Option 1

Spring - Same as Option 1 except you do not take the thesis and register for the Comprehensive Exam.  As a result, you will be less than part-time b/c you will have 3 units in the spring. In this situation, the Research seminar in the Fall has served as your elective.  You can, if you like, take another elective if you want to keep you at part-time.
