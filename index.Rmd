# Introduction

The thesis allows students to develop their ideas and interests in a structured way with faculty support.  The greatest benefit of the thesis is that it allows you to better explore and understand an area of passion and interest to the student.  Theses represent an opporutunity to showcase their word to doctoral programs or employers.



## Timeline



| Thesis Steps          | Semester | Year |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Meet with Dr. Bedic and discuss topics | Fall | 1 |
| Complete a literature review in 564 | Fall  | 1 |
| Review and revise literature review with Dr. Bedics | Spring | 1 |
| Select a Committee | Spring | 1 |
| Create Project Template in Ethics | Summer |  |
| Thesis Seminar (PSYC 565) | Fall | 2  |
| Independent Thesis Credits | Spring | 2  |


## Full Comprehensive Exam Option

If you decided, 100%, on comprehensive exams and will not take the Research Seminar in the Fall:

Courses in your second year include:

| Class          | Semester | Units | 
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| ABA | Fall  | 3  |
| Specialization Part I | Fall | 3 |
| Elective | Spring | 3 |
| Specialization Part II | Spring | 3 |
| Comprehensive Exam | Spring | 0 |

The elective (3-units) could be Part II of any specialization or anything that Dr. Bedics approves.  The 3-units are required to make up for not having the Research Seminar in the Fall. You also want to take this in the Spring b/c if you take in the Fall you will only have 3 units in the spring which will make you less than part-time (not good!).



## Thesis Lite Version

Here you can take the Research Seminar (565) in the Fall but not complete the thesis in the spring. People do this when they want to start a research project but then use it as a launching pad for a dissertation so they do not collect data in the Spring.  People also use this when they start the thesis with the intent to collect data but things do not work out with their sample or other issues come up that would prevent completion of the thesis.

Courses in your second year include:

| Class          | Semester | Units | 
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Research Seminar (565) | Fall | 3 |
| ABA | Fall  | 3  |
| Specialization Part I | Fall | 3 |
| Specialization Part II | Spring | 3 |
| Comprehensive Exam | Spring | 0 |

In this situation, the Research seminar in the Fall has served as your elective.  You can, if you like, take another elective if you want to maintain your part-time student status.
